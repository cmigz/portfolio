## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio. Currently my proudest representation of my designing skills.  I wanted to exude a lot of personality for this page so I took a character from one of my beloved games and decided to try using Adobe Illustrator to create a version that shows Christian the Developer.

A great learning opportunity presented itself with this project as well.  While originally formatted using the Bootstrap Grid system I picked up FlexBox and refactored the site for more control and ease of modifying its mobile responsiveness.

## Deployed Link

- **Deployed Page:** https://cmigz.github.io/portfolio

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:**
  - The barebones skeleton of my project.  Used to build the framework for the page.
- **CSS:**
  - Set up media queries in order to handle response to being viewed on a mobile screen.
  - Picked up FlexBox and will never go back.  Refactored majority of project out of using Bootstrap Grids and using FlexBox instead.
- **SASS:**
  - Utilized SASS keys to make the styling process streamlined.
  - Additionally used nested selectors to have a more focused styling in certain sections
- **jQuery:**
  - The first time I've used jQuery screen size functionality to adjust functions based on screen width.
- **Adobe Illustrator:**
  - I really wanted to make a personalized image for my portfolio.  So I downloaded and stumbled my way through learning Adobe Illustrator and was very proud with the results for the landing image.
