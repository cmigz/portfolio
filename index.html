          <hr class="star-light">
          <div class="row">
            <h3 class="sub-header">Hey, welcome to my portfolio.<br>My name is Christian.</h3>
            <h3 class="sub-header">Coder | Entrepreneur | Gamer</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              I've always been a very methodical and analytical person.  When I discovered my passion and ability for coding I realized I had found what I was meant to do in this life.
              <br><br>
              I consider myself a very well rounded developer.  As much as I love designing a beautiful and responsive front-end with a smooth UI  I have the same vigor for building databases and creating API's so my clients don't get so lonely and have someone to talk to.
              <br><br>
              My personal philosophy focuses on two key aspects of life.  Constantly strive for self-improvement, and always treat others as you'd want to be treated yourself.  I come from a hard-working old-school Italian family where going above beyond is the standard.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
              Ok, that's enough self-aggrandizing for now.  Let me step away from 'Christian' the developer and tell you about the person.
              <br><br>
              All my life I've been a gamer.  It's not even the act alone that keeps me captivated, its the world of gaming and it's culture.  I also have a great appreciation of good television, by that I mean the writing, the acting, all of it.  If you've gotten this far it should come as no surprise that I'm also a huge comic book aficionado.  Would you believe me if I told you Alan Moore's 1998 interpretation of "The Swamp Thing" is one of the best love stories of all time? Trust me.
              <br><br>
              One of the proudest personal accomplishments is I can say that when I lost my leg at the age of 13 I taught myself how to walk again.  I was young, stubborn, and so lost with such a drastic shift of my status quo.  But the fact is I consider that to be one of the greatest things to ever happen to me.  Had I not gone through that I would not have come out the other side being the thankful, empathetic, badass that I am today.

          <p class="section-text">
            As I am someone who is always hungry to learn something cool and new I am continually growing my base of knowledge every day.  With confidence, I can say when given a new language or technology that I have the drive, tenacity, and capacity to quickly learn the basic patterns and in a short time acquire a firm foundation.
            <br><br>
            While this applies to various aspects of development my true interest lies in improving efficiency.  What can I do to make A, B, and C work smarter, faster, and provide better results?

                  Aside from my portfolio, this is a project that really has a lot of my own personality imbued within it.  While my sketching skills lag behind my development skills I've always enjoyed drawing what my brain envisions when listening to certain songs.  The purpose of this page is to be a place where a user can view, upload, and share their drawings of the songs that inspire them.
                  <br><br>
                  Some future plans for this project include changing the formatting/layout to better scale for different drawing and screen sized.  Additionally, I really look forward to adding a social component such as allowing users to comment on other's drawings.

                <p class="thumbnail-text">
                  Chris Turco Law is where my coding journey began.  A friend had recently passed the bar and was opening his own firm.  I told him he'd need a website, having no idea where to start he asked if I would set him up one.  At the time I'd had close to no exposure to web development.  I built the first iteration of the site using WordPress and learning some HTML/CSS to customize some of the their plugins.
                  <br><br>
                  After completing GA's Web Development Immersive program I re-tackled the project with all the information I'd learned and started it over from scratch. Using a marketing template for the layout of out landing and keeping speed in mind you'll see the newer version (linked in the button below) runs much faster and has a better flow then the <a target='_blank' href='http://christurcolaw.com/wordpress1/'>original version</a>.
                  <br><br>
                  Source code is in a private repository which I'd be happy to share upon request.

                  An informational site for a local sign setting business.  It is meant to be a destination where customers can view the work the company and does and get some idea on their pricing and availability.
                  <br><br>
                  At the time of this update (1/5/2018) I am near complete with a CRM platform for this page.  It will act as a customer portal for the ordering and installation of the signs. Built with a Rails backend and utilizing React for the front end the project will go a long way to help streamline the companies process.

                  My first foray into building a full-stack web app where I built both the front-end client and the back-end API.
                  <br><br>
                  As a result of my love for video games in addition to my collector's mentality, I built Migz Collectibles.  A page where a user can create an account where they can upload, track, and edit their video game collection.

                  Currently my proudest representation of my designing skills.  I wanted to exude a lot of personality for this page so I took a character from one of my beloved games and decided to try using Adobe Illustrator to create a version that shows Christian the Developer.
                  <br><br>
                  A great learning opportunity presented itself with this project as well.  While originally formatted using the Bootstrap Grid system I picked up FlexBox and refactored the site for more control and ease of modifying its mobile responsiveness.

                  A group project during our time with GA.  Our prompt was to build an Amazon-like e-commerce site.  That in mind combined with the fact that at the time Amazon had recently acquired Whole Foods we decided to create a new produce branch of the site.
                  <br><br>
                  With this project, a lot of the learning was outside of code and more focused on working with others, learning how to handle differing personalities, and how to bring it all together into a final product which we could all be proud of.
