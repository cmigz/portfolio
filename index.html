            <h3 class="text-center">Hey, welcome to my portfolio.  My name is Christian.</h3>
            <h4 class="text-center">Coder | Entrepreneur | Gamer</h4>
            <br>
            <p>When I discovered my passion for coding I had realized that I had finally found what I was meant to do in this life.  I employ a personal philosophy of always working to improve one's self in addition to treating others as I'd like to be treated.  I come from a hard working old school Italian family where going above beyond is the standard, and look forward to applying that work ethic to the world of web development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I want to give you an idea of who I am, I think this short story will suffice.  I was diagnosed with Bacterial Meningitis when I was two, the result was a childhood in and out of the hospital that culminated in the choice to amputate my left foot when I was thirteen.  When it comes down to it I consider this to be one of the greatest blessings in my life.  Had I not struggled through that I wouldnt be the determined, focused, and rounded person I am today.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On a more enjoyable note I am a huge video game and comic book afficianado.  I've been playing since I was a kid, and its always been a passion.  While I was never going to be the start quarterback I could kick anyone's ass in super smash brothers.  Comics has only recently become one of my greater loves in this life, but when I dove in I dove deep.  Going on three years now my cousin and I sell comics at the cons that come to town and those weekends are often my favorites times of the year.</p>

                <h3>CharDee-Mac-Toe</h3>
                <p>My first project during my time with GA.  It is a game of tic-tac-toe built with a custom JavaScript game logic, uses AJAX to make asychronous communication with a back end serve, and utilizes user authentication to sign in and track game stats.</p>

                <h3>Migz Collectibles</h3>
                <p>As a result of my love for video games in addition to my collectors mentality, for my second project I decided to create and application for tracking one's video game collection.  This application uses a custom built rails API and a front-end which utilizes AJAX to create a seemless single page application.</p>

                <h3>Peach Produce</h3>
                <p>Our first project with GA in which we worked in teams in an effort to simulate to real development field as much as possible.  With this project a lot of the learning was outside of code and more focused on working with others, learning how to handle differing personalities, and how to bring it all together into a final product which we could all be proud of. </p>
