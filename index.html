              When I discovered my passion for coding I had realized that I had finally found what I was meant to do in this life.  I employ a personal philosophy of always working to improve one's self in addition to treating others as I'd like to be treated.  I come from a hard working old school Italian family where going above beyond is the standard, and look forward to applying that work ethic to the world of web development.

              I am a huge video game and comic book afficianado.  I've been playing since I was a kid, and its always been a passion.  While I was never going to be the start quarterback I could kick anyone's ass in super smash brothers.  Comics has only recently become one of my greater loves in this life, but when I dove in I dove deep.  Going on three years now my cousin and I sell comics at the cons that come to town and those weekends are often my favorites times of the year.

              If you want a quick one word summary for this section I'd have to say its adaptability.  I can say with confidence when given a new language or framework that I possess the drive, methodology, and ability to quickly find the basic patterns and in a short time acquire a solid foundation.

              As I am someone who is consistently striving for self-improvement these lists will surely expand as time goes on.  I tend to gravitate towards what will help me make task X cleaner, smarter, and as simple as possible.

With this project a lot of the learning was outside of code and more focused on working with others, learning how to handle differing personalities, and how to bring it all together into a final product which we could all be proud of. </p>

                <p class="thumbnail-text">My capstone project during my time at GA.  MuseArt was a real passion project for me.  I by no stretch of the imagination consider myself an artist but on and off since high school I've always enjoyed doodling what my brain envisions when listening to a song.  Combine that with my desire to share them with other and in hopes of finding those that do the same came the idea for MuseArt.  In time I plan to add more social componentns such as commenting and messaging, I'd really like to get this one in paritular to production level and share with the world.</p>

                <h3>Chris Turco Law</h3>
                <p class="thumbnail-text">My first endeavor in the world of web development.  At the time of building this site I'd had no real exposure to web development.  Using WordPress and some basic HTML/CSS to customize certain aspects I was very proud of what I accomplished and through the process got hooked on coding and haven't looked back since.
                <br>
                <br>
                    In addition to building the site I also worked with a freelancer to get logo, held a photo shoot and took all the photos myself (aside from some stock photos we purchased), and trained my friend on creating/running ad campaigns as well as social media accounts.  In the short time the site has been live we've been able to bring in around a dozen clients.  Now with the skills I've gained in GA I plan to rebuild the site from scratch with some additional features, for example a portal for his clients to be able to view theirs bill and more. </p>
